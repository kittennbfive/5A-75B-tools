This is a small note on how to update the toolchain for ECP5. Please consider with caution, it works for me but i am really bad with git...

The commands are all entered as normal user, not as root (except for make install if you don't use sudo).

I assume you already have a directory Yosys/ or similar with the 3 subprojects!

PRJTRELLIS:
cd prjtrellis/
git pull
git submodule update
cd libtrellis/
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install

YOSYS:
cd yosys/
git pull
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install

NEXTPNR:
cd nextpnr/
git pull
cmake . -DARCH=ecp5 -DTRELLIS_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
