This is a collection of scripts (Perl5) to get a more visual representation of the Pinout of the ECP5-FPGA and see what is connected where.

VALID ONLY FOR 5A-75B VERSION 7.0!

These scripts are for Linux only, however it should be possible to modify them for Windows as there is very little OS-specific stuff.

How to use: 
1)download everything in the same folder
2)chmod +x make_all
3)./make_all
4)open result.htm with your favorite webbrowser (tested with Firefox)

Notes:
My HTML/CSS/JS-skills are _really_ limited. I tried to keep the stuff as simple as possible, for me it works fine.
